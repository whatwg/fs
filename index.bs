# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is non-normative.*

This document defines fundamental infrastructure for file system APIs. In addition, it defines an
API that makes it possible for websites to get access to a file system directory without having to
first prompt the user for access. This enables use cases where a website wants to save data to disk
before a user has picked a location to save to, without forcing the website to use a completely
different storage mechanism with a different API for such files. The entry point for this is the
{{StorageManager/getDirectory()|navigator.storage.getDirectory()}} method.


# Files and Directories # {#files-and-directories}

## Concepts ## {#concepts}

A <dfn export id="entry">file system entry</dfn> is either a [=file entry=] or a [=directory entry=].

Each [=/file system entry=] has an associated
<dfn for="file system entry" id=entry-query-access>query access</dfn>
algorithm, which takes "`read`" or "`readwrite`" <var ignore>mode</var> and
returns a [=/file system access result=].
Unless specified otherwise it returns a [=/file system access result=] with a
[=file system access result/permission state=] of "{{PermissionState/denied}}"
and with an [=file system access result/error name=] of the empty string.

Each [=/file system entry=] has an associated
<dfn for="file system entry" id=entry-request-access>request access</dfn>
algorithm, which takes "`read`" or "`readwrite`" <var ignore>mode</var> and
returns a [=/file system access result=].
Unless specified otherwise it returns a [=/file system access result=] with a
[=file system access result/permission state=] of "{{PermissionState/denied}}"
and with an [=file system access result/error name=] of the empty string.

A <dfn export>file system access result</dfn> is a [=struct=] encapsulating the
result of [=file system entry/query access|querying=] or
[=file system entry/request access|requesting=] access to the file system.
It has the following [=struct/items=]:

: <dfn for="file system access result">permission state</dfn>
:: A {{PermissionState}}
: <dfn for="file system access result">error name</dfn>
:: A [=string=] which must be the empty string if
   [=file system access result/permission state=] is
   "{{PermissionState/granted}}"; otherwise an
   [=DOMException/name=] listed in the [=`DOMException` names table=].
   It is expected that in most cases when
   [=file system access result/permission state=] is not
   "{{PermissionState/granted}}", this should be "{{NotAllowedError}}".

<p class=warning> Dependent specifications may consider this API a
[=powerful feature=]. However, unlike other [=powerful features=] whose
[=permission request algorithm=] may throw, [=/file system entry=]'s
[=file system entry/query access=] and [=file system entry/request access=]
algorithms must run [=in parallel=] on the [=file system queue=] and are
therefore not allowed to throw. Instead, the caller is expected to
[=queue a storage task=] to [=/reject=], as appropriate,
should these algorithms return an [=file system access result/error name=]
other than the empty string.

Note: Implementations that only implement this specification and not dependent
specifications do not need to bother implementing [=/file system entry=]'s
[=file system entry/query access=] and [=file system entry/request access=].

Issue(101): Make access check algorithms associated with a FileSystemHandle.

Each [=/file system entry=] has an associated <dfn for="file system entry" id=entry-name>name</dfn> (a [=string=]).

A <dfn>valid file name</dfn> is a [=string=] that is not an empty string, is not equal to "." or "..",
and does not contain '/' or any other character used as path separator on the underlying platform.

Note: This means that '\' is not allowed in names on Windows, but might be allowed on
other operating systems. Additionally underlying file systems might have further restrictions
on what names are or aren't allowed, so a string merely being a [=valid file name=] is not
a guarantee that creating a file or directory with that name will succeed.

Issue: We should consider having further normative restrictions on file names that will
never be allowed using this API, rather than leaving it entirely up to underlying file
systems.

A <dfn export id=file>file entry</dfn> additionally consists of
<dfn for="file entry" export>binary data</dfn> (a [=byte sequence=]), a
<dfn for="file entry">modification timestamp</dfn> (a number representing the number of milliseconds since the <a spec=FileAPI>Unix Epoch</a>),
a <dfn for="file entry">lock</dfn> (a string that may exclusively be "`open`", "`taken-exclusive`" or "`taken-shared`")
and a <dfn for="file entry">shared lock count</dfn> (a number representing the number shared locks that are taken at a given point in time).

A user agent has an associated <dfn>file system queue</dfn> which is the
result of [=starting a new parallel queue=]. This queue is to be used for all
file sytem operations.

<div algorithm>
To <dfn for="file entry/lock">take</dfn> a [=file entry/lock=] with a |value| of
"`exclusive`" or "`shared`" on a given [=file entry=] |file|:

1. Let |lock| be the |file|'s [=file entry/lock=].
1. Let |count| be the |file|'s [=file entry/shared lock count=].
1. If |value| is "`exclusive`":
   1. If |lock| is "`open`":
     1. Set lock to "`taken-exclusive`".
     1. Return "`success`".
1. If |value| is "`shared`":
   1. If |lock| is "`open`":
     1. Set |lock| to "`taken-shared`".
     1. Set |count| to 1.
     1. Return "`success`".
   1. Otherwise, if |lock| is "`taken-shared`":
     1. Increase |count| by 1.
     1. Return "`success`".
1. Return "`failure`".

Note: These steps have to be run on the [=file system queue=].

</div>

<div algorithm>
To <dfn for="file entry/lock">release</dfn> a [=file entry/lock=] on a given
[=file entry=] |file|:

1. Let |lock| be the |file|'s associated [=file entry/lock=].
1. Let |count| be the |file|'s [=file entry/shared lock count=].
1. If |lock| is "`taken-shared`":
  1. Decrease |count| by 1.
  1. If |count| is 0, set |lock| to "`open`".
1. Otherwise, set |lock| to "`open`".

Note: These steps have to be run on the [=file system queue=].

</div>

Note: Locks help prevent concurrent modifications to a file. A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}}
requires a shared lock, while a {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}} requires an exclusive one.

A <dfn export id=directory>directory entry</dfn> additionally consists of a [=/set=] of
<dfn for="directory entry">children</dfn>, which are themselves [=/file system entries=].
Each member is either a [=/file entry=] or a [=/directory entry=].

A [=/file system entry=] |entry| should be [=list/contained=] in the [=directory entry/children=] of at most one
[=directory entry=], and that directory entry is also known as |entry|'s
<dfn export for="file system entry" id=entry-parent>parent</dfn>.
A [=/file system entry=]'s [=file system entry/parent=] is null if no such directory entry exists.

Note: Two different [=/file system entries=] can represent the same file or directory on disk, in which
case it is possible for both entries to have a different parent, or for one entry to have a
parent while the other entry does not have a parent.

[=/File system entries=] can (but don't have to) be backed by files on the host operating system's local file system,
so it is possible for the [=binary data=], [=modification timestamp=],
and [=directory entry/children=] of entries to be modified by applications outside of this specification.
Exactly how external changes are reflected in the data structures defined by this specification,
as well as how changes made to the data structures defined here are reflected externally
is left up to individual user-agent implementations.

A [=/file system entry=] |a| is <dfn for="file system entry">the same entry as</dfn>
a [=/file system entry=] |b| if |a| is equal to |b|, or
if |a| and |b| are backed by the same file or directory on the local file system.

<div algorithm>

To <dfn for="file system locator" id=locator-resolve>resolve</dfn> a
[=/file system locator=] |child| relative to a [=directory locator=] |root|:

1. Let |result| be [=a new promise=].
1. [=Enqueue the following steps=] to the [=file system queue=]:
  1. If |child|'s [=FileSystemHandle/locator=]'s [=file system locator/root=]
     is not |root|'s [=FileSystemHandle/locator=]'s [=file system locator/root=],
     [=/resolve=] |result| with null, and abort these steps.

  1. Let |childPath| be |child|'s [=FileSystemHandle/locator=]'s [=file system locator/path=].
  1. Let |rootPath| be |root|'s [=FileSystemHandle/locator=]'s [=file system locator/path=].
  1. If |childPath| is [=the same path as=] |rootPath|,
     [=/resolve=] |result| with « », and abort these steps.

  1. If |rootPath|'s [=list/size=] is greater than |childPath|'s [=list/size=],
     [=/resolve=] |result| with null, and abort these steps.

  1. [=list/For each=] |index| of |rootPath|'s [=list/indices=]:
    1. If |rootPath|.\[[|index|]] is not |childPath|.\[[|index|]], then
       [=/resolve=] |result| with null, and abort these steps.

  1. Let |relativePath| be « ».
  1. [=list/For each=] |index| of [=the range=] from |rootPath|'s [=list/size=]
     to |rootPath|'s [=list/size=], exclusive,
     [=list/append=] |childPath|.\[[|index|]] to |relativePath|.

  1. [=/Resolve=] |result| with |relativePath|.

1. Return |result|.

</div>

A <dfn export>file system locator</dfn> represents a potential location of a
[=/file system entry=]. A [=/file system locator=] is either a [=file locator=]
or a [=directory locator=].

Each [=/file system locator=] has an associated <dfn export for="file system locator" id=locator-path>path</dfn> (a [=/file system path=]),
a <dfn export for="file system locator" id=locator-kind>kind</dfn> (a {{FileSystemHandleKind}}), and
a <dfn export for="file system locator" id=locator-root>root</dfn> (a [=file system root=]).

Issue(109): Consider giving each locator a [=storage bucket=].

A <dfn export>file locator</dfn> is a [=/file system locator=] whose
[=file system locator/kind=] is {{FileSystemHandleKind/"file"}}.
A <dfn export>directory locator</dfn> is a [=/file system locator=] whose
[=file system locator/kind=] is {{FileSystemHandleKind/"directory"}}.

A <dfn export>file system root</dfn> is an opaque [=string=] whose value is
[=implementation-defined=].

<p class=example id=example-locator>For a [=/file system locator=] |locator|
whichs [=locate an entry|locates to=] a [=file entry=] |entry| that conceptually
exists at the path `data/drafts/example.txt` relative to the root directory of
a [=/bucket file system=],
|locator|'s [=file system locator/kind=] has to be {{FileSystemHandleKind/"file"}},
|locator|'s [=file system locator/path=] has to be « "`data`", "`drafts`", "`example.txt`" », and
|locator|'s [=file system locator/root=] might include relevant identifying
information such as the [=storage bucket=] and the disk drive.

A [=/file system locator=] |a| is <dfn for="file system locator">the same locator as</dfn>
a [=/file system locator=] |b| if
|a|'s [=file system locator/kind=] is |b|'s [=file system locator/kind=],
|a|'s [=file system locator/root=] is |b|'s [=file system locator/root=], and
|a|'s [=file system locator/path=] is [=the same path as=] |b|'s [=file system locator/path=].

<div algorithm>
The <dfn export data-lt="locating an entry">locate an entry</dfn> algorithm given a
[=/file system locator=] |locator| runs an [=implementation-defined=] series of steps adhering to
these constraints:

- If |locator| is a [=file locator=], they return a [=file entry=] or null.
- If |locator| is a [=directory locator=], they return a [=directory entry=] or null.
- If these steps return a non-null |entry|, then:
  - [=Getting the locator=] with |entry| returns |locator|,
    provided no intermediate file system operations were run.
  - |entry|'s [=file system entry/name=] is the last [=list/item=] of |locator|'s
    [=file system locator/path=].

</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn export data-lt="getting the locator">get the locator</dfn> algorithm given
[=/file system entry=] |entry| runs an [=implementation-defined=] series of steps adhering to these
constraints:

- If |entry| is a [=file entry=], they return a [=file locator=].
- If |entry| is a [=directory entry=], they return a [=directory locator=].
- If these steps return |locator|, then:
  - [=Locating an entry=] with |locator| returns |entry|,
    provided no intermediate file system operations were run.
  - |entry|'s [=file system entry/name=] is the last [=list/item=] of |locator|'s
    [=file system locator/path=].

</div>

A <dfn export>file system path</dfn> is a [=/list=] of one or more [=strings=].
This may be a virtual path that is mapped to real location on disk or in memory,
may correspond directly to a path on the local file system, or may not
correspond to any file on disk at all. The actual physical location of the
corresponding [=/file system entry=] is [=implementation-defined=].

<p class=example id=example-path>Let |path| be the [=/list=]
« "`data`", "`drafts`", "`example.txt`" ».
There is no expectation that a file named `example.txt` exists anywhere on disk.

A [=/file system path=] |a| is <dfn for="file system path">the same path as</dfn>
a [=/file system path=] |b| if
|a|'s [=list/size=] is the same as |b|'s [=list/size=] and
[=list/for each=] |index| of |a|'s [=list/indices=]
|a|.\[[|index|]] is |b|.\[[|index|]].

<p class=warning> The contents of a [=/file system locator=], including its
[=file system locator/path=], are not expected to be shared in their entirety
with the website process. The [=/file system path=] might contain components
which are not known to the website unless the [=/file system locator=] is later
[=file system locator/resolved=] relative to a parent [=directory locator=].

## The {{FileSystemHandle}} interface ## {#api-filesystemhandle}

<xmp class=idl>
enum FileSystemHandleKind {
  "file",
  "directory",
};

[Exposed=(Window,Worker), SecureContext, Serializable]
interface FileSystemHandle {
  readonly attribute FileSystemHandleKind kind;
  readonly attribute USVString name;

  Promise<boolean> isSameEntry(FileSystemHandle other);
};
</xmp>

A {{FileSystemHandle}} object is associated with a <dfn for=FileSystemHandle export>locator</dfn> (a
[=/file system locator=]).

Note: Multiple {{FileSystemHandle}} objects can have
[=the same locator as|the same=] [=/file system locator=].

A {{FileSystemHandle}}
<dfn for=FileSystemHandle export>is in a bucket file system</dfn>
if the first [=list/item=] of its [=FileSystemHandle/locator=]'s
[=file system locator/path=] is the empty string.

Note: This is a bit magical, but it works since only the root directory of a
[=/bucket file system=] can have a [=file system locator/path=] which
[=list/contains=] an empty string. See {{StorageManager/getDirectory()}}.
All other [=list/item=]s of a [=file system locator/path=] will be a
[=valid file name=].

Issue(109): Consider improving this situation by giving each locator a
[=storage bucket=].

<div algorithm="serialization steps">

### The {{FileSystemFileHandle/createWritable()}} method ### {#api-filesystemfilehandle-createwritable}

<div class="note domintro">

     User agents try to ensure that no partial writes happen, i.e. the file
     will either contain its old contents or it will contain whatever data was written
     through |stream| up until the stream has been closed.

     This is typically implemented by writing data to a temporary file, and only replacing the
     [=file entry=] [=locate an entry|locatable=] by |fileHandle|'s [=FileSystemHandle/locator=]
     with the temporary file when the writable filestream is closed.

     If {{FileSystemCreateWritableOptions/keepExistingData}} is false or not specified,
     the temporary file starts out empty,
     otherwise the existing file is first copied to this temporary file.

     Creating a {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} [=file entry/lock/take|takes a shared lock=] on the
     [=file entry=] [=locate an entry|locatable=] with |fileHandle|'s [=FileSystemHandle/locator=].
     This prevents the creation of {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle|FileSystemSyncAccessHandles}}
     for the entry, until the stream is closed.

<p class=XXX>See <a href=https://github.com/WICG/file-system-access/issues/67>WICG/file-system-access issue #67</a>
for discussion around and desire for a "inPlace" mode for createWritable (where
changes will be written to the actual underlying file as they are written to the
writer, for example to support in-place modification of large files or things
like databases). This is not currently implemented in Chrome. Implementing this
is currently blocked on figuring out how to combine the desire to run malware
checks with the desire to let websites make fast in-place modifications to
existing large files. In-place writes are available for files in a

     The returned {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle}} offers synchronous methods. This allows for higher performance

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[file]]</dfn> (a [=file entry=]).

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[buffer]]</dfn> (a [=byte sequence=]).
It is initially empty.

Note: This buffer can get arbitrarily large, so it is expected that implementations will not keep this in memory,
but instead use a temporary file for this. All access to \[[buffer]] is done in promise returning methods and
algorithms, so even though operations on it seem sync, implementations can implement them async.

A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has an associated <dfn for=FileSystemWritableFileStream>\[[seekOffset]]</dfn> (a number).
It is initially 0.

<div class="note domintro">
A {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} object is a {{WritableStream}} object with additional
convenience methods, which operates on a single file on disk.

Upon creation, an underlying sink will have been created and the stream will be usable.
All operations executed on the stream are queuable and producers will be able to respond to backpressure.

The underlying sink's write method, and therefore {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()|WritableStreamDefaultWriter's write()}}
method, will accept byte-like data or {{WriteParams}} as input.

The {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} has a file position cursor initialized at byte offset 0 from the top of the file.
When using {{FileSystemWritableFileStream/write()|write()}} or by using WritableStream capabilities through the {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()|WritableStreamDefaultWriter's write()}} method, this position will be advanced based on the number of bytes written through the stream object.

Similarly, when piping a {{ReadableStream}} into a {{FileSystemWritableFileStream}} object, this position is updated with the number of bytes that passed through the stream.

{{WritableStream/getWriter()|getWriter()}} returns an instance of {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter}}.

1. If the operations modifying the [=this=]'s[=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s
   [=file entry/binary data=] in the previous steps failed:
    1. If there were partial writes and the number of bytes that were written from |buffer| is known:
        1. Let |bytesWritten| be the number of bytes that were written from |buffer|.
        1. Set [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] to |writePosition| + |bytesWritten|.
        1. Return |bytesWritten|.
    1. Otherwise [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Set [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] to |writePosition| + |bufferSize|.
1. Return |bufferSize|.

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/truncate()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-truncate}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/truncate()|truncate}}(|newSize|)
  :: Resizes the file associated with |handle| to be |newSize| bytes long. If |newSize| is larger than the current file size this pads the file with null bytes; otherwise it truncates the file.

  :: The file cursor is updated when {{truncate}} is called. If the cursor is smaller than |newSize|, it remains unchanged. If the cursor is larger than |newSize|, it is set to |newSize|.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>truncate(|newSize|)</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=]'s [=[[state]]=] is "`closed`",
   [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Let |fileContents| be a copy of [=this=]'s
   [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=].
1. Let |oldSize| be the [=byte sequence/length=] of [=this=]'s
   [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=].
1. If the underlying file system does not support setting a file's size to
   |newSize|, [=throw=] a {{TypeError}}.
1. If |newSize| is larger than |oldSize|:
   1. If |newSize| &minus; |oldSize| exceeds the available [=storage quota=],
      [=throw=] a "{{QuotaExceededError}}" {{DOMException}}.
   1. Set [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s to a
      [=byte sequence=] formed by concatenating |fileContents| with a
      [=byte sequence=] containing |newSize| &minus; |oldSize| 0x00 bytes.
   1. If the operations modifying the [=this=]'s
      [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=]
      in the previous steps failed,
      [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Otherwise, if |newSize| is smaller than |oldSize|:
   1. Set [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s to a
      [=byte sequence=] containing the first |newSize| bytes in |fileContents|.
   1. If the operations modifying the [=this=]'s
      [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s [=file entry/binary data=]
      in the previous steps failed,
      [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. If [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] is greater than |newSize|, then set [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/file position cursor=] to |newSize|.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/getSize()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-getsize}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/getSize()}}
  :: Returns the size of the file associated with |handle| in bytes.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>getSize()</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=]'s [=[[state]]=] is "`closed`",
   [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Return [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=]'s
   [=file entry/binary data=]'s [=byte sequence/length=].

</div>

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/flush()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-flush}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/flush()}}
  :: Ensures that the contents of the file associated with |handle| contain all the modifications done through {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/write()}}.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>flush()</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=]'s [=[[state]]=] is "`closed`",
   [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}}.
1. Attempt to transfer all cached modifications of the file's content to the
   file system's underlying storage device.

   Note: This is also known as flushing. This may be a no-op on some file
   systems, such as in-memory file systems, which do not have a "disk" to flush
   to.

</div>

### The {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/close()}} method ### {#api-filesystemsyncaccesshandle-close}

<div class="note domintro">
  : |handle| . {{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/close()}}
  :: Closes the access handle or no-ops if the access handle is already closed.
     This disables any further operations on it and
     [=file entry/lock/release|releases the lock=] on the
     [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=] associated with |handle|.
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle>close()</dfn> method steps are:

1. If [=this=]'s [=[[state]]=] is "`closed`", return.
1. Set [=this=]'s [=[[state]]=] to "`closed`".
1. Set |lockReleased| to false.
1. Let |file| be [=this=]'s [=FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/[[file]]=].
1. [=Enqueue the following steps=] to the [=file system queue=]:
  1. [=file entry/lock/release|Release the lock=] on |file|.
  1. Set |lockReleased| to true.
1. [=Pause=] until |lockReleased| is true.

Note: This method does not guarantee that all file modifications will be
immediately reflected in the underlying storage device. Call the
{{FileSystemSyncAccessHandle/flush()}} method first if you require this
guarantee.

# Accessing the Bucket File System # {#sandboxed-filesystem}

The <dfn export>bucket file system</dfn> is a [=storage endpoint=] whose
<a spec=storage for="storage endpoint">identifier</a> is `"fileSystem"`,
<a spec=storage for="storage endpoint">types</a> are `« "local" »`,
and <a spec=storage for="storage endpoint">quota</a> is null.

Issue: Storage endpoints should be defined in [[storage]] itself, rather
than being defined here. So merge this into the table there.

Note: While user agents will typically implement this by persisting the contents of a
[=/bucket file system=] to disk, it is not intended that the contents are easily
user accessible. Similarly there is no expectation that files or directories with names
matching the names of children of a [=/bucket file system=] exist.

<xmp class=idl>
[SecureContext]
partial interface StorageManager {
  Promise<FileSystemDirectoryHandle> getDirectory();
};
</xmp>

<div class="note domintro">
  : |directoryHandle| = await navigator . storage . {{StorageManager/getDirectory()}}
  :: Returns the root directory of the [=/bucket file system=].
</div>

<div algorithm>
The <dfn method for=StorageManager>getDirectory()</dfn> method steps are:

1. Let |environment| be the [=current settings object=].

1. Let |map| be the result of running [=obtain a local storage bottle map=]
   with |environment| and `"fileSystem"`. If this returns failure,
   return [=a promise rejected with=] a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}}.

1. If |map|["root"] does not [=map/exist=]:
  1. Let |dir| be a new [=directory entry=] whose [=query access=] and
     [=request access=] algorithms always return
     a [=/file system access result=]
     with a [=file system access result/permission state=]
     of "{{PermissionState/granted}}" and
     with an [=file system access result/error name=] of the empty string.
  1. Set |dir|'s [=file system entry/name=] to the empty string.
  1. Set |dir|'s [=directory entry/children=] to an empty [=/set=].
  1. Set |map|["root"] to |dir|.

1. Let |root| be an [=implementation-defined=] opaque [=string=].
1. Let |path| be « the empty string ».
1. Let |handle| be the result of <a>creating a new `FileSystemDirectoryHandle`</a>.
   given |root| and |path| in the [=current realm=].

  Note: |root| might include relevant identifying information such as the
  [=storage bucket=].

1. Assert: [=locating an entry=] given |handle|'s [=FileSystemHandle/locator=]
   returns a [=directory entry=] that is [=the same entry as=] |map|["root"].

1. Return [=a promise resolved with=] |handle|.
